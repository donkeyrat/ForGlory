# For Glory

A long-time requested mod, For Glory adds dismemberment and blood effects to TABS! Battles are all the more satisfying, and you can look across the field of bodies and see missing limbs and heads. Explosions, melee weapons, and ranged weapons all have a new layer of spice, and blood!

### If you have trouble with the mod, or if you just want to chat, you can join the [TABS Mod Center](https://discord.gg/zrs44qyp7S).

### This mod is [**open source**](https://github.com/donkeyrat/ForGlory).

## How To Use

Start a battle, and you'll see blood effects! 

You can tweak the intensity of the blood in your Bug DLC settings, as well as enable or disable team colored blood, enable or disable skeleton blood, and tweak the size of blood splats. 

You can also disable dismemberment entirely, or enable having units die after getting dismembered, just so they aren't walking around while headless like a chicken.
